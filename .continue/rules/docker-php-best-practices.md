  These rules ensure optimal PHP configuration, proper development and
  production environments, efficient dependency management, and adherence to
  Symfony best practices in containerized environments.

# PHP/Symfony Docker Best Practices

1. Use official PHP images as base (php:X.Y-fpm-distribution).
2. Use Debian-based images (bookworm) for better compatibility with PHP extensions.
3. Use install-php-extensions script for PHP extension installation.
4. Install specific PHP extensions required for Symfony:
   - intl: for internationalization
   - opcache: for performance optimization
   - pcntl: for process control
   - xsl: for XML transformations
   - zip: for package handling
5. Install composer with a pinned version using @composer-X.Y.Z syntax.
6. Install dev tools like Xdebug only in the development image.
7. Control Xdebug via environment variables (XDEBUG_MODE, XDEBUG_CLIENT_HOST, etc.).
8. Configure optimal PHP settings for development vs. production environments.
9. Move the production php.ini into place in the production image.
10. Configure opcache for production with:
    - opcache.validate_timestamps=0
    - opcache.memory_consumption=128
    - opcache.max_accelerated_files=10000
11. Install Symfony CLI only in the development image.
12. Use dumb-init to properly handle process signals in containerized PHP applications.
13. Implement a custom entrypoint that installs Composer and NPM dependencies if not present.
14. Mount custom PHP configuration files (like xdebug.ini) as read-only volumes.
15. Organize PHP configuration files in etc/docker/php/conf.d/ directory.
16. Set APP_ENV environment variable appropriately for each environment.
