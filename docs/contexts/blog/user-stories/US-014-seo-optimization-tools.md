## Test Scenarios

### Behat Scenarios
```gherkin
Feature: SEO optimization tools
  As an author
  I want SEO optimization tools
  So that my content ranks well

  Background:
    Given I am creating an article

  Scenario: Automatic slug generation
    When I enter title "10 Best Practices for Remote Work"
    Then slug should auto-generate as "10-best-practices-for-remote-work"
    And slug field should be editable

  Scenario: Custom slug validation
    Given slug "remote-work-tips" exists
    When I try to use "remote-work-tips"
    Then I should see "Slug already in use"
    And suggestions:
      | remote-work-tips-2024 |
      | remote-work-tips-guide |

  Scenario: Meta description validation
    When I enter meta description "Short"
    Then I should see "Too short (min 120 characters)"
    When I enter 200 characters
    Then I should see "Too long (max 160 characters)"
    When I enter 140 characters
    Then I should see "âœ“ Good length"

  Scenario: Real-time SEO scoring
    Given I have article with:
      | Title: "Tips" |
      | Content: "Some content" |
      | No meta description |
    Then SEO score should be "Poor (45/100)"
    And I should see issues:
      | Title too short (min 30 chars) |
      | Content too short (min 300 words) |
      | Missing meta description |

  Scenario: SEO improvements
    Given my article has SEO score 45
    When I implement suggestions:
      | Extend title to "10 Essential Remote Work Tips for 2024" |
      | Add meta description |
      | Add 2 internal links |
      | Include focus keyword 3-5 times |
    Then SEO score should improve to 85+
    And status should be "Good SEO"

  Scenario: Publishing validation
    Given I try to publish with score 30
    Then I should see warning "Low SEO score may affect visibility"
    And suggestions to improve before publishing
    But I can still publish if I confirm
