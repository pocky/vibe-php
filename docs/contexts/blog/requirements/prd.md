- **Content Creation**: Enable easy creation and management of blog articles
- **Content Organization**: Support categorization and tagging for improved content discovery
- **Author Attribution**: Track and display content authorship
- **Dual Interface**: Provide both administrative interface and API for content consumption
- **Simplicity**: Focus on core blogging features without authentication overhead

### 1.3 Success Metrics
- Time to create and publish an article: < 5 minutes
- API response time: < 200ms for content retrieval
- Content organization efficiency: 100% of articles categorized and tagged
- System uptime: 99.9% availability

### 1.4 High-Level Scope
- **In Scope**: Article management, categories, tags, authors, admin UI, REST API
- **Out of Scope**: User authentication, comments, media management, themes, plugins

## 2. Business Requirements

### 2.1 Problem Statement
Content creators need a streamlined platform to publish and organize blog content without the complexity of full-featured CMS systems. Many WordPress installations use only a fraction of available features, creating unnecessary overhead.

**Current Pain Points:**
- Overly complex systems for simple blogging needs
- Authentication overhead for single-author or team blogs
- Difficult API integration for headless content delivery
- Poor separation between content management and delivery

**Opportunity:**
Create a focused blog system that excels at core content management tasks while providing modern API capabilities for flexible content consumption.
