### Risk Assessment & Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
1. **Complex Domain Logic**: Mitigated through comprehensive testing and iterative development
2. **Performance with Large Datasets**: Addressed via proper indexing, pagination, and caching
3. **Integration Complexity**: Managed through event-driven architecture and clear boundaries

**Development Risks**:
1. **Feature Creep**: Controlled through strict iteration boundaries and PRD alignment
2. **Over-Engineering**: Focus on working software over perfect architecture
3. **Quality Degradation**: Continuous QA tool validation and peer review

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Iterative Development**: Complete vertical slices per phase
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage at all layers
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and alerting
- **Documentation**: Living documentation updated with code changes
