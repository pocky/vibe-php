# AI Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for effectively collaborating with AI agents in software development. These practices help ensure productive interactions while maintaining developer autonomy and code quality.

## Core Philosophy: Augmentation, Not Replacement

The fundamental principle of working with AI agents is that they should **augment human intelligence, not replace it**. AI agents are tools that amplify your capabilities, not substitutes for critical thinking.

### Key Principles

1. **Maintain Ownership**: You own the decisions, the AI provides options and implementation
2. **Question-First Approach**: AI should understand before acting
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Start simple, iterate based on feedback
4. **Transparent Reasoning**: AI should explain its approach and trade-offs

## The Two-Step Approach: Think Then Do

Effective AI collaboration separates planning from execution:

### Step 1: Planning Phase
- **Define Clear Objectives**: Be specific about what you want to achieve
- **Discuss Constraints**: Share technical, business, and architectural requirements
- **Review Approach**: Have the AI explain its intended approach before implementing
- **Iterate on the Plan**: Refine until the approach aligns with your vision

### Step 2: Implementation Phase
- **Incremental Execution**: Implement in small, reviewable chunks
- **Maintain Context**: Keep the AI informed of changes and decisions
- **Verify Output**: Review and test generated code before accepting
- **Request Adjustments**: Don't hesitate to ask for modifications

## The Importance of Planning Mode

When available, always use a "plan" mode or create a detailed task list before implementing significant changes. This critical step prevents costly mistakes and ensures alignment with project goals.

### Why Planning Mode Matters

1. **Prevents Premature Implementation**: Stops AI from jumping directly into code
2. **Enables Review Before Action**: You can validate the approach before any changes
3. **Maintains Project Coherence**: Ensures new work aligns with existing architecture
4. **Facilitates Discussion**: Creates space for refining requirements
5. **Documents Decisions**: Leaves a trail of why certain choices were made

### Using Plan Mode Effectively

**When AI provides plan mode:**
```
AI: I'll help you implement this feature. Let me create a plan first.

[Plan details...]

Would you like me to proceed with this implementation?
```

**Your review should check:**
- Does this align with our architecture?
- Are all edge cases considered?
- Is the scope appropriate?
- Are there any missing requirements?

### Creating Task Lists When Plan Mode Isn't Available

If the AI doesn't have a built-in plan mode, always request a task breakdown:

**Good Practice:**
> "Before we start coding, please create a detailed task list for implementing the payment processing feature. Break it down into specific, actionable items."

**Example Task List:**
```
1. [ ] Design payment service interface
2. [ ] Implement Stripe integration adapter
3. [ ] Create payment validation logic
4. [ ] Add database schema for payment records
5. [ ] Write unit tests for payment service
6. [ ] Implement API endpoints
7. [ ] Add error handling and logging
8. [ ] Create integration tests
9. [ ] Update documentation
```

### Task List Benefits

- **Clear Scope**: Everyone knows what will be done
- **Progress Tracking**: Check off completed items
- **Risk Identification**: Spot potential issues early
- **Time Estimation**: Better understand effort required
- **Parallel Work**: Identify independent tasks

### Red Flags to Avoid

**❌ Jumping into implementation:**
> "Let me implement that for you..." [starts coding immediately]

**✅ Proper approach:**
> "Let me first outline what needs to be done, then we can review the plan together."

### Planning for Different Scenarios

**Large Features**: Always use plan mode or detailed task lists
**Bug Fixes**: Quick plan of investigation and fix approach
**Refactoring**: List all files affected and transformation steps
**Integration**: Map out connection points and data flow

Remember: A few minutes of planning saves hours of debugging and rework.

## Choosing the Right Model for the Task

Different AI models excel at different aspects of development. Using the right model for each task significantly improves results:

### Reasoning and Architecture (Gemini Pro, Claude Opus)
These models excel at:
- **System Design**: Breaking down complex requirements into architectures
- **Problem Analysis**: Understanding intricate business logic and constraints
- **Trade-off Evaluation**: Comparing different approaches and their implications
- **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive technical specifications
- **Code Review**: Analyzing existing code for improvements and issues

**When to Use**:
> "I need to design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform that can handle 100k concurrent users"

> "What are the trade-offs between using event sourcing vs traditional CRUD for this audit system?"

### Code Implementation (Claude Sonnet, GPT-4)
These models excel at:
- **Writing Code**: Generating clean, idiomatic code following best practices
- **Refactoring**: Improving existing code structure and performance
- **Bug Fixing**: Identifying and resolving specific code issues
- **Test Creation**: Writing comprehensive test suites
- **API Integration**: Implementing integrations with external services

**When to Use**:
> "Implement the user authentication service following the design we discussed"

> "Refactor this @src/services/PaymentProcessor.js to use the strategy pattern"

### Optimal Workflow Example

1. **Start with a reasoning model** (Gemini Pro/Claude Opus):
   > "I need to implement a real-time notification system. Users should receive instant updates when someone comments on their posts. What architecture would you recommend considering we have 50k active users?"

2. **Review and refine the approach** with the reasoning model

3. **Switch to a coding model** (Claude Sonnet) with context:
   > "Based on our discussion, please implement the WebSocket notification service using the architecture we defined. Here's the interface from @src/interfaces/NotificationService.ts"

### Model Switching Benefits
- **Better Quality**: Each model performs its specialty optimally
- **Cost Efficiency**: Coding models are often more economical for implementation
- **Faster Results**: Specialized models work more efficiently in their domain
- **Clearer Thinking**: Separation helps maintain clarity between planning and doing

## Effective Communication Patterns

### Starting a Task

**Good**:
> "I need to implement user authentication. We're using JWT tokens and need to support email/password login. The system should track failed attempts for security. What approach would you recommend?"

**Less Effective**:
> "Add login to my app"

### Providing Feedback

**Good**:
> "The approach looks good, but we need to use our existing User model instead of creating a new one. Also, let's use bcrypt for password hashing to match our security standards."

**Less Effective**:
> "That's wrong, fix it"

### Referencing Files and Resources

Using the `@` symbol to reference files and resources is crucial for maintaining context and ensuring AI agents work with the correct information:

**Why It Matters**:
- **Precise Context**: AI knows exactly which file you're discussing
- **Avoid Ambiguity**: No confusion about file locations or names
- **Better Suggestions**: AI can analyze the actual code structure
- **Maintain Consistency**: Changes align with existing patterns

**Good Examples**:
> "Can you update the user validation in @src/models/User.js to include email format checking?"

> "Following the pattern in @lib/auth/jwt.ts, implement refresh token functionality"

> "The tests in @tests/unit/UserTest.php need to cover the new password reset feature"

**Less Effective**:
> "Update the user file" (Which file? Where?)

> "Make it like the other authentication" (Which implementation?)

## Quality Control Practices

### Code Review Workflow
1. **AI Generates**: Initial implementation based on requirements
2. **Human Reviews**: Check for correctness, style, and architectural fit
3. **Collaborative Refinement**: Iterate together on improvements
4. **Human Approves**: Final decision on what gets committed

### Testing Strategy
- **Test-First When Possible**: Ask AI to write tests before implementation
- **Review Test Coverage**: Ensure critical paths are tested
- **Validate Edge Cases**: AI might miss unusual scenarios
- **Integration Testing**: Verify the code works in your system
