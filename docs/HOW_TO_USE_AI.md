```bash
# Start a new feature with planning
/spec:plan Add category management to blog system

# Define requirements
/spec:requirements blog-categories

# Create technical design
/spec:design

# Break down into TDD tasks
/spec:tasks

# Implement with TDD
/act

# Run quality assurance
/workflow:qa
```

### 2. Local development methodology

The project follows a structured spec-driven development methodology defined in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

#### Spec-driven development

The methodology provides a structured approach with explicit approval gates:

1. **Planning** - Break down into manageable features
2. **Requirements** - Define WHAT needs to be built (EARS format)
3. **Design** - Define HOW it will be built
4. **Tasks** - Break down into TDD steps
5. **Implementation** - Code following Red-Green-Refactor
6. **Quality Assurance** - Mandatory validation

#### Available commands

All commands are defined in `.claude/commands/` with specific purposes:

**Core workflow commands:**
- Planning and requirements definition
- Technical design generation
- Task breakdown for TDD
- Implementation execution
- Quality assurance

**Domain-specific commands:**
- Value object creation
- Entity and aggregate implementation
- Gateway pattern implementation
- CQRS command/query handlers

#### Command workflow

```

## üìã Recommended workflow

### For a new feature

1. **Planning** (with human input)
   - Define business needs
   - Assess impact on existing architecture
   - Decide on technical constraints

2. **AI-assisted specification**
   ```
   /spec:plan Add email notification system for article publishing
   ```

3. **Requirements definition**
   ```
   /spec:requirements article-notifications
   ```

4. **Technical design** (mandatory human validation)
   ```
   /spec:design
   ```

5. **TDD implementation**
   ```
   /spec:tasks
   /act
   ```

6. **Quality assurance** (mandatory)
   ```
   /workflow:qa
   ```

7. **Human review** (mandatory)
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Code review
   - Business validation

### For maintenance/debugging

1. **Problem analysis**
   ```
   /utils:debug error "Class not found exception in ArticleRepository"
   ```

2. **Solution research**
   - AI suggests approaches
   - You validate business relevance

3. **Controlled implementation**
   - Minimal changes
   - Test coverage maintained
   - QA validation

## üöÄ Integration with existing tools

### With Docker Compose

```bash
# Run commands in Docker environment
docker compose exec app composer qa
docker compose exec app bin/phpunit
docker compose exec app bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

### With project QA tools

The project enforces strict quality standards:

```bash
# Run full QA suite
docker compose exec app composer qa

# Individual tools
docker compose exec app composer qa:ecs      # Code style
docker compose exec app composer qa:phpstan   # Static analysis
docker compose exec app composer qa:rector    # Code modernization
docker compose exec app composer qa:phpunit   # Unit tests
docker compose exec app composer qa:behat     # Functional tests
```

**QA is MANDATORY** - No feature is complete without passing all checks.

### With Git and PRs

Follow semantic commit conventions:
```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat(blog): add category management"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in cache service"

# With breaking change
git commit -m "feat!: restructure API response format

BREAKING CHANGE: API responses now use envelope format"
```
