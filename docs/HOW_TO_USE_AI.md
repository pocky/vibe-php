## 🎯 Purpose of this document

This guide explains how to use artificial intelligence tools available to the team to improve your development productivity. These tools are designed to **assist** you in your daily tasks, **not to replace you**.

## ⚠️ Important warning

> **AI tools are assistants, not replacements**
> 
> - They can make mistakes
> - They don't always understand the complete business context
> - Their code must **always** be reviewed and tested
> - Your human expertise remains **irreplaceable**
> - Never blindly trust AI suggestions

## 🛠️ Available tools

### 1. Claude Code - AI Development Assistant

[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) is Anthropic's official development assistant that understands your codebase and provides contextual assistance.

#### Access

Claude Code is available at: https://claude.ai/code

**Requirements:**
- Claude Pro subscription
- Modern web browser
- Project files accessible locally

#### Project-specific Configuration

The project includes comprehensive documentation and methodology:

**📁 Key files:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Main project instructions and standards
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Spec-driven development methodology
- `.claude/commands/` - Slash command definitions
- `docs/reference/` - Architecture and development guidelines

**🏗️ Architecture:**
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Hexagonal Architecture
- CQRS pattern
- Gateway pattern
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)

#### Slash Commands

The project uses a command-driven workflow with custom slash commands:

**Specification workflow:**
- `/spec:plan` - Break down project into features
- `/spec:requirements` - Detail EARS-formatted requirements
- `/spec:design` - Generate technical design
- `/spec:tasks` - Create TDD implementation tasks
- `/act` - Execute TDD implementation

**Code generation:**
- `/code:hexagonal:value-object` - Create value objects
- `/code:hexagonal:entity` - Create domain entities
- `/code:hexagonal:aggregate` - Create aggregate roots
- `/code:hexagonal:gateway` - Create application gateways
- `/code:hexagonal:command` - Create CQRS commands
- `/code:hexagonal:query` - Create CQRS queries

**Quality assurance:**
- `/workflow:qa` - Run quality checks
- `/utils:qa` - Quality assurance utilities
- `/utils:debug` - Debug assistance

**Documentation:**
- `/utils:adr` - Create Architecture Decision Records
- `/utils:prd` - Create Product Requirements Documents
- `/utils:user-story` - Create user stories

#### Recommended usage

**✅ Best practices:**
- Use spec-driven workflow for new features
- Follow TDD methodology with Red-Green-Refactor
- Provide business context in requirements
- Reference existing files with `@` notation
- Run QA checks continuously during development

**❌ Avoid:**
- Implementing without tests
- Skipping quality assurance
- Accepting code without review
- Making architectural decisions without validation
- Sharing sensitive information

#### Usage examples

```bash
# Start a new feature with planning
/spec:plan Add category management to blog system

# Define requirements
/spec:requirements blog-categories

# Create technical design
/spec:design

# Break down into TDD tasks
/spec:tasks

# Implement with TDD
/act

# Run quality assurance
/workflow:qa
```

### 2. Local development methodology

The project follows a structured spec-driven development methodology defined in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

#### Spec-driven development

The methodology provides a structured approach with explicit approval gates:

1. **Planning** - Break down into manageable features
2. **Requirements** - Define WHAT needs to be built (EARS format)
3. **Design** - Define HOW it will be built
4. **Tasks** - Break down into TDD steps
5. **Implementation** - Code following Red-Green-Refactor
6. **Quality Assurance** - Mandatory validation

#### Available commands

All commands are defined in `.claude/commands/` with specific purposes:

**Core workflow commands:**
- Planning and requirements definition
- Technical design generation
- Task breakdown for TDD
- Implementation execution
- Quality assurance

**Domain-specific commands:**
- Value object creation
- Entity and aggregate implementation
- Gateway pattern implementation
- CQRS command/query handlers

#### Command workflow

```

## 📋 Recommended workflow

### For a new feature

1. **Planning** (with human input)
   - Define business needs
   - Assess impact on existing architecture
   - Decide on technical constraints

2. **AI-assisted specification**
   ```
   /spec:plan Add email notification system for article publishing
   ```

3. **Requirements definition**
   ```
   /spec:requirements article-notifications
   ```

4. **Technical design** (mandatory human validation)
   ```
   /spec:design
   ```

5. **TDD implementation**
   ```
   /spec:tasks
   /act
   ```

6. **Quality assurance** (mandatory)
   ```
   /workflow:qa
   ```

7. **Human review** (mandatory)
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Code review
   - Business validation

### For maintenance/debugging

1. **Problem analysis**
   ```
   /utils:debug error "Class not found exception in ArticleRepository"
   ```

2. **Solution research**
   - AI suggests approaches
   - You validate business relevance

3. **Controlled implementation**
   - Minimal changes
   - Test coverage maintained
   - QA validation

## 🚀 Integration with existing tools

### With Docker Compose

```bash
# Run commands in Docker environment
docker compose exec app composer qa
docker compose exec app bin/phpunit
docker compose exec app bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

### With project QA tools

The project enforces strict quality standards:

```bash
# Run full QA suite
docker compose exec app composer qa

# Individual tools
docker compose exec app composer qa:ecs      # Code style
docker compose exec app composer qa:phpstan   # Static analysis
docker compose exec app composer qa:rector    # Code modernization
docker compose exec app composer qa:phpunit   # Unit tests
docker compose exec app composer qa:behat     # Functional tests
```

**QA is MANDATORY** - No feature is complete without passing all checks.

### With Git and PRs

Follow semantic commit conventions:
```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat(blog): add category management"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in cache service"

# With breaking change
git commit -m "feat!: restructure API response format

BREAKING CHANGE: API responses now use envelope format"
```

## 💡 Conclusion

AI tools are **force multipliers** for our development team. Used correctly, they can:

- Accelerate feature development
- Improve code quality and consistency
- Enhance test coverage
- Reduce repetitive tasks
- Maintain high standards

But they never replace:

- Your business expertise
- Your technical judgment
- Your responsibility for code quality
- Your understanding of the codebase
- Your collaboration with the team

**Use them as intelligent assistants, not as autonomous developers.**

Remember: **Quality is mandatory**. No feature is complete without passing all QA checks.
