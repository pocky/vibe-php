1. PRD (Define) â†’ 2. Plan (Design) â†’ 3. Act (Build) â†’ 4. Report (Improve)
```

### 1. PRD Phase
Define WHAT needs to be built:
- Problem statement
- User stories  
- Acceptance criteria
- Scope boundaries

### 2. Plan Phase
Design HOW to build it:
- Technical approach
- Architecture decisions
- Implementation steps
- Time estimates

### 3. Act Phase
Build the solution:
- Follow checklist
- Implement incrementally
- Test as you go
- Document decisions

### 4. Report Phase
Capture insights:
- What went well
- What to improve
- Lessons learned
- Process updates

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start a new feature
/prd user-authentication

# After PRD is complete
/plan

# Start building
/act

# After implementation
/report
```

## Tips
- Complete each phase before moving to the next
- Use TodoWrite to track progress
- Review AI suggestions critically
- Document key decisions
