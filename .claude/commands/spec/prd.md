I'll help you create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document for "{{feature-name}}" in the {{context-name}} context, combining business vision with structured EARS requirements.

```

## Setting up the PRD workflow

First, I'll create a todo list to track our progress through the PRD creation process.

[Use TodoWrite to create the following tasks:
- üéØ Define business vision and objectives for {{feature-name}} (in_progress, high)
- üìã Document requirements using EARS format (pending, high)
- üìù Create user stories with acceptance criteria (pending, high)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Define technical constraints and NFRs (pending, medium)
- ‚úÖ Prepare for approval gate review (pending, medium)]

## Information Gathering

To create a comprehensive PRD with structured requirements, I need to understand:

### 1. Business Context
- **What problem does {{feature-name}} solve?**
- **Who are the primary users and what are their pain points?**
- **What are the key business goals and success metrics?**
- **What is the expected impact on the business?**

### 2. Functional Scope
- **What are the core capabilities needed?**
- **What are the user workflows?**
- **What are the integration points with existing systems?**
- **What are the data requirements?**

### 3. Constraints & Requirements
- **What are the performance requirements?**
- **What are the security and compliance needs?**
- **What are the timeline and resource constraints?**
- **What are the technical limitations?**

## Document Structure

I'll create the following structure:

```
docs/contexts/{{context-name}}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prd.md                          # This comprehensive PRD
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user-stories/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ US-001-[story-name].md     # Individual user stories
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ US-002-[story-name].md
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ design/                             # (Created in next phase)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implementation/                     # (Created in implementation phase)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ iterations/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ iteration-planning.md           # Release planning
```

## PRD Template

### 1. Executive Summary
- Product vision and value proposition
- Key objectives and success metrics
- High-level scope and timeline

### 2. Business Requirements

#### 2.1 Problem Statement
- Current state and pain points
- Opportunity analysis
- Expected outcomes

#### 2.2 User Personas
- Primary users and their goals
- User needs and expectations
- Usage scenarios

#### 2.3 Success Metrics
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Measurement methods
- Target values

### 3. Functional Requirements (EARS Format)

#### 3.1 Core Requirements
Using EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax):

**Ubiquitous Requirements:**
- `REQ-001`: The system SHALL [provide capability]
- `REQ-002`: The system SHALL [maintain state]

**Event-Driven Requirements:**
- `REQ-010`: WHEN [user action] THEN the system SHALL [response]
- `REQ-011`: WHEN [system event] THEN the system SHALL [action]

**State-Driven Requirements:**
- `REQ-020`: WHILE [system state] the system SHALL [behavior]
- `REQ-021`: WHILE [process running] the system SHALL [constraint]

**Conditional Requirements:**
- `REQ-030`: IF [condition] THEN the system SHALL [action]
- `REQ-031`: IF [error state] THEN the system SHALL [recovery]

**Optional Requirements:**
- `REQ-040`: WHERE [feature enabled] the system SHALL [capability]

#### 3.2 Business Rules
- Validation rules and constraints
- Calculation formulas
- Decision logic

#### 3.3 User Interface Requirements
- UI/UX principles
- Accessibility requirements
- Responsive design needs

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

#### 4.1 Performance
- Response time requirements
- Throughput expectations
- Scalability needs

#### 4.2 Security
- Authentication requirements
- Authorization model
- Data protection needs

#### 4.3 Reliability
- Availability targets
- Error handling
- Recovery procedures

#### 4.4 Compatibility
- Browser/device support
- API versioning
- Backward compatibility

### 5. User Stories Overview

#### 5.1 Foundation User Story (MANDATORY)

Each iteration/feature MUST begin with a foundation user story that:
- **Sets up the core data models and infrastructure** needed by all other stories
- **Establishes the basic CRUD operations** that other features will build upon
- **Creates the essential domain objects** (entities, value objects, aggregates)
- **Implements the fundamental business rules** that govern the feature
- **Provides the minimal viable functionality** that can be tested independently

**Example**: For a blog context, US-001 "Basic Article Management" would create:
- Article entity with core fields (id, title, content, status, timestamps)
- Basic create/read/update operations via gateways
- Essential validation rules (title required, content required)
- Domain events (ArticleCreated, ArticleUpdated)
- Repository interface and basic implementation

#### 5.2 User Stories Summary

Summary of all user stories with:
- Story ID and title
- Story type (Foundation/Feature/Enhancement)
- Priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Estimated effort
- Dependencies (especially on foundation story)

### 6. Constraints and Assumptions

#### 6.1 Technical Constraints
- Technology stack limitations
- Infrastructure constraints
- Integration limitations

#### 6.2 Business Constraints
- Budget limitations
- Timeline requirements
- Resource availability

#### 6.3 Assumptions
- External dependencies
- Market conditions
- User behavior assumptions

### 7. Risks and Mitigation

- Technical risks
- Business risks
- Mitigation strategies

### 8. Appendices

- Glossary of terms
- Reference documents
- Mockups and diagrams

## EARS Format Guidelines

### Best Practices:
1. **Use SHALL for mandatory requirements** (not "should" or "will")
2. **Be specific and measurable** (e.g., "within 2 seconds" not "quickly")
3. **One requirement per statement**
4. **Avoid ambiguous terms** ("appropriate", "user-friendly", "reasonable")
5. **Make requirements testable**

### Examples:
- ‚úÖ Good: "WHEN a user submits an order THEN the system SHALL send confirmation within 5 seconds"
- ‚ùå Bad: "The system should handle orders appropriately"

## User Story Template

Each user story will follow this structure:

```markdown
# US-XXX: [Story Title]

## Story Type
- [ ] **Foundation** - First story of iteration, sets up core infrastructure
- [ ] **Feature** - Adds new functionality, depends on foundation
- [ ] **Enhancement** - Improves or extends existing features

## Story
As a [user type]
I want to [action/feature]
So that [benefit/value]

## Dependencies
- **Foundation Story**: US-XXX (if this is not a foundation story)
- **Other Dependencies**: [List any other story dependencies]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given [context] When [action] Then [outcome]
- [ ] Given [context] When [action] Then [outcome]

## Technical Foundation (for Foundation stories only)
- **Domain Objects**: [List entities, value objects, aggregates to create]
- **Core Operations**: [List CRUD operations to implement]
- **Business Rules**: [List fundamental rules to enforce]
- **Infrastructure**: [List repositories, services to create]

## Technical Notes
- Related requirements: REQ-XXX, REQ-YYY
- Considerations: [Technical considerations]

## Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: [Description]
2. **Edge Case**: [Description]
3. **Error Case**: [Description]
```

## Next Steps

1. I'll gather the requirements information
2. Create the comprehensive PRD document
3. Break down into detailed user stories
4. Prepare for approval gate review

## Setting up directory structure

Now I'll create the necessary directory structure for the PRD documentation.

[Use Bash to run: mkdir -p docs/contexts/{{context-name}}/{requirements/user-stories,design,implementation,iterations}]

## PRD Generation Process

Based on your requirements, I'll now generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document for {{feature-name}} in the {{context-name}} context.

[The PRD content will be generated here based on the user's input]

## Ready to Save the PRD

[Use exit_plan_mode with the following plan:]

I've generated the Product Requirements Document for {{feature-name}} in the {{context-name}} context.

### Next Actions:
1. **Save the PRD** to `docs/contexts/{{context-name}}/requirements/prd.md`
2. **Create user story files** for each identified story
3. **Set up the directory structure** for the feature

### Approval Questions:
1. **Do the requirements accurately capture the business needs?**
2. **Are all user scenarios covered?**
3. **Are the success metrics clear and measurable?**
4. **Are there any missing requirements or constraints?**
5. **Is the scope appropriate for the timeline and resources?**

Once approved, I will:
- Save all the generated documents
- Confirm the files have been created
- You can then proceed to the technical design phase with `/spec:design`

Would you like me to save the PRD and create the necessary files?
