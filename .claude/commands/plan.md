I'll help you create a detailed technical architecture and implementation plan. Let me analyze your requirements and design a robust solution.

## Architecture Planning Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis 📋

First, I need to understand your requirements completely. Please provide:

1. **What are you trying to build?** (Main functionality)
2. **Who will use this?** (Target users/systems)
3. **What are the key constraints?** (Performance, budget, timeline)
4. **Any specific technical requirements?** (Frameworks, integrations)

I'll analyze:
- Explicit functional requirements
- Implied non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- Technical constraints and dependencies
- Success criteria and metrics

### My Architectural Approach

I follow these principles:
- **Modular Design**: Components should be loosely coupled and highly cohesive
- **Future-Proof**: Architecture should accommodate reasonable future changes
- **Technical Debt Awareness**: Identify and plan for managing technical debt
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive identification and mitigation of technical risks
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Align architecture with business domains

### What I'll Deliver

1. **Architecture Options** - 2-3 viable approaches with trade-offs
2. **Component Design** - Detailed component specifications
3. **Technical Stack** - Recommended technologies and justifications
4. **Implementation Phases** - Broken down into manageable deliverables
5. **Risk Assessment** - Technical risks and mitigation strategies

### Next Steps

Once you provide the requirements, I'll:
1. Analyze the existing codebase structure
2. Design appropriate architecture patterns
3. Create detailed technical specifications
4. Provide a phased implementation roadmap

Please share your requirements and any existing documentation or constraints I should consider.
