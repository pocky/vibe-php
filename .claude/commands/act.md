description: Begin implementation with TDD approach and implementation checklist
---

I'll guide you through a Test-Driven Development implementation following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

## Implementation Process

### Architecture & Patterns
I follow established patterns from our documentation:
- **@docs/reference/php-implementation-patterns.md** - Modern PHP patterns and best practices
- **@docs/agent/workflows/tdd-implementation-guide.md** - Complete TDD workflow
- **@docs/reference/domain-layer-pattern.md** - Domain modeling guidelines
- **@docs/reference/cqrs-pattern.md** - Command/query separation patterns
- **@docs/reference/gateway-pattern.md** - Entry point implementation
- **@docs/agent/workflows/act-checklist.md** - Implementation checklist

### TDD Workflow

    A[üî¥ RED<br/>Write Failing Test] --> B[üü¢ GREEN<br/>Make Test Pass]
    B --> C[‚ôªÔ∏è REFACTOR<br/>Improve Code]
    C --> A
```

#### Core Principles:
- **Test First**: Always write the test before implementation
- **Small Steps**: One test, one feature at a time
- **Clear Intent**: Tests describe expected behavior
- **Fast Feedback**: Run tests frequently
- **Clean Code**: Refactor only when tests are green

### Quality Standards
- **PHP 8.4 Features**: Property hooks, asymmetric visibility, enums
- **Architecture Compliance**: DDD, Hexagonal, Clean Architecture
- **Code Quality**: ECS, PHPStan, Rector, PHPUnit

## Starting Implementation

When you use this command, I will:

1. **Create TODO list** with TDD phases
2. **Check available plans** in docs/plan/
3. **Identify first feature** to implement
4. **Create failing test** immediately
5. **Implement minimal code** to pass test
6. **Continue TDD cycle** with file creation

This command starts the implementation process and creates real files following our established patterns and quality standards.
