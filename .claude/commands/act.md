I'll guide you through a Test-Driven Development implementation following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. Let me set up our workflow and checklist.

## TDD Implementation Guide

### Current Phase: üî¥ RED - Write a Failing Test

I'll help you follow Test-Driven Development principles:

1. **Write a test that fails** - Define the expected behavior
2. **Run the test** - Confirm it fails for the right reason
3. **Write minimal code** - Just enough to make the test pass
4. **Refactor** - Improve the code while keeping tests green

### Key Principles I'll Follow:

- **Test First**: Always write the test before the implementation
- **Small Steps**: One test, one feature at a time
- **Clear Intent**: Tests should describe what the code should do
- **Fast Feedback**: Run tests frequently to validate changes
- **Clean Code**: Refactor only when tests are passing

### Before We Start:

Please tell me:
1. What feature or functionality do you want to implement?
2. Do you have a specific testing framework preference (PHPUnit, Pest, etc.)?
3. Any specific requirements or constraints I should know about?

I'll then guide you through each phase of the TDD cycle, ensuring we:
- Write meaningful, focused tests
- Implement only what's needed
- Keep our code clean and maintainable
- Commit at appropriate points when all tests pass
