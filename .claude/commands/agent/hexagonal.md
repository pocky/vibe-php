# Hexagonal Agent

Launch a specialized agent for Domain-Driven Design and Hexagonal Architecture implementation.

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW

This agent uses a structured approach:
1. **Domain Scaffolding**: Uses `/code:hexagonal:*` commands to generate domain components
2. **Implementation**: Automatically generated code with proper structure
3. **Business Logic**: Implements custom business logic and validation

**CRITICAL**: This agent MUST create ALL domain components systematically!
- Create ALL value objects identified in requirements
- Create the aggregate with proper structure
- Create ALL gateways for each operation
- Create repository interface
- Create domain events
- Implement business logic with proper validation

**Domain Implementation Approach:
1. Use scaffolding for structure
2. Implement business rules
3. Ensure proper validation and error handling**

- **`/workflow:qa`** - Run quality assurance checks

## Hexagonal Agent Implementation

I am a Domain-Driven Design expert specializing in hexagonal architecture. I will implement your feature by creating ALL domain components systematically.

### 🔑 Key Innovations

#### 1. Dynamic Component Discovery
This agent **dynamically extracts components** from your technical design document instead of using hardcoded examples. This means:
- **Works for ANY domain**: Product, Order, User, Payment, etc.
- **Reads YOUR design**: Parses technical-design.md to find actual components
- **Complete coverage**: Creates ALL components found in the design
- **No hardcoding**: No more "Article" specific references

#### 2. Structured Implementation Approach
This agent uses a **systematic implementation approach**:
- **Proper structure**: Every component follows domain patterns
- **Validation first**: All inputs are validated
- **Design patterns**: Follows hexagonal architecture principles
- **Quality focus**: Clean, maintainable code from the start

### How It Works

1. **Phase 1**: Analyzes your requirements and technical design
2. **Pattern Extraction**: Uses the extraction guide to identify components
3. **Phase 2**: Lists all discovered components dynamically
4. **Phase 3**: Generates scaffolding for YOUR specific domain:
   - Creates proper domain structure
   - Implements validation rules
   - Generates clean implementation
   - Ensures architectural consistency
5. **Verification**: Checks that all components were created properly

## Phase 1: Complete Requirements Analysis

Let me analyze ALL requirements to identify EVERY component needed:

[Use Read to check user story: docs/contexts/{{context}}/requirements/user-stories/{{feature}}.md]
[Use Read to check if requirements exist: docs/contexts/{{context}}/requirements/prd.md]
[Use Read to check if design exists: docs/contexts/{{context}}/design/technical-design.md]
[Use Read to check if tasks exist: docs/contexts/{{context}}/features/{{feature}}/tasks.md]

## Pattern Extraction Guide

### How to Extract Components from Technical Design

When reading the technical design document, use these patterns to identify components:

#### 1. **Aggregates** (Section 2.1)
Look for patterns like:
- `#### {{Name}} Aggregate`
- `{{Name}} (Aggregate Root)`
- Extract: The aggregate name (e.g., "Article", "Category", "Author")

#### 2. **Value Objects** (Section 2.2)
Look for patterns like:
- `├── {{Name}} (VO)`
- `{{Name}} (Value Object)`
- Items listed under "**Value Objects:**"
- Extract: The value object name (e.g., "ArticleId", "Title", "Email")

#### 3. **Enums** (Section 2.2)
Look for patterns like:
- `**Enums:**`
- `{{Name}}: {{values}}`
- Items with fixed values (e.g., "DRAFT, PUBLISHED")
- Extract: The enum name (e.g., "ArticleStatus")

#### 4. **Commands** (Section 3.1)
Look for patterns like:
- `{{Action}}{{Entity}}Command`
- Commands listed under "**{{Entity}} Commands:**"
- Extract: The full command name (e.g., "CreateArticleCommand")

#### 5. **Queries** (Section 3.2)
Look for patterns like:
- `{{Get|List|Search}}{{Entity}}Query`
- Queries listed under "**{{Entity}} Queries:**"
- Extract: The full query name (e.g., "GetArticleQuery")

#### 6. **Domain Events** (Section 2.3)
Look for patterns like:
- `{{Entity}}{{Action}}`
- Events listed with past tense verbs
- Extract: The event name (e.g., "ArticleCreated", "CategoryUpdated")

#### 7. **Gateways** (Section 3.3)
Look for directory structure:
```
Application/Gateway/
├── {{OperationName}}/
```
Extract: The operation name (e.g., "CreateArticle", "ListCategories")

### Example Extraction Process:

From this technical design snippet:
```
#### Article Aggregate (Root)
├── ArticleId (VO)
├── Title (VO)
├── ArticleStatus (Enum)

CreateArticleCommand
├── title: string
├── content: string

ArticleCreated
├── articleId: string
```

Extract:
- Aggregate: "Article"
- Value Objects: "ArticleId", "Title"
- Enum: "ArticleStatus"
- Command: "CreateArticle"
- Event: "ArticleCreated"

## Phase 2: Complete Component Identification

Based on the technical design analysis, I will identify ALL domain components dynamically:

[Use Read to check: docs/contexts/{{context}}/design/technical-design.md]

### Extracting Components from Technical Design

I'll analyze the following sections from the technical design:
1. **Domain Model Design** → Section 2: Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects
2. **Application Layer Design** → Section 3: Commands, Queries, Gateways  
3. **Domain Events** → Section 2.3: Event definitions

[Parse the technical design to extract:]
- **Aggregates**: Look for "#### {{Name}} Aggregate" in section 2.1
- **Value Objects**: Find items marked with "(VO)" in section 2.2
- **Commands**: Extract from "{{Action}}{{Entity}}Command" patterns in section 3.1
- **Queries**: Extract from "{{Get|List|Search}}{{Entity}}Query" patterns in section 3.2
- **Domain Events**: Find "{{Entity}}{{Action}}" patterns in section 2.3
- **Gateways**: Extract operation names from section 3.3 Gateway structure

### Identified Components:

**Aggregates** (from section 2.1):
{{#each aggregates}}{{this}}{{/each}}

**Value Objects** (from section 2.2):
{{#each valueObjects}}{{this}}{{/each}}

**Operations/Use Cases** (from sections 3.1-3.3):
{{#each operations}}{{this}}{{/each}}

**Domain Events** (from section 2.3):
{{#each domainEvents}}{{this}}{{/each}}

**Repository Interfaces**:
{{#each aggregates}}{{this}}RepositoryInterface{{/each}}

[Use TodoWrite to create implementation tasks based on extracted components:
- 📋 Complete requirements analysis (hex-1, completed, high)
- 🔨 Create ALL value objects: {{list all VOs found}} (hex-2, in_progress, high)
- 🆔 Create ID generators for: {{list all aggregates}} (hex-3, pending, high)
- 📦 Create aggregates: {{list all aggregates}} (hex-4, pending, high)
- 🏭 Create domain services for operations (hex-5, pending, high)
- 🎯 Create domain events: {{list all events}} (hex-6, pending, high)
- 📚 Create repository interfaces: {{list all repos}} (hex-7, pending, high)
- 🚪 Create ALL gateways: {{list all operations}} (hex-8, pending, high)
- 📝 Create CQRS commands/queries (hex-9, pending, medium)
- 🧪 Create tasks.md for customization (hex-10, pending, medium)
- 💻 Execute implementation (hex-11, pending, high)
- ✅ Run quality assurance (hex-12, pending, low)]

## Phase 3: Systematic Scaffolding Execution

**I will now execute ALL scaffolding commands to create the COMPLETE domain structure:**

### 📦 Implementation Workflow for Each Component
For every component created:
1. **STRUCTURE**: Generate proper domain structure
2. **VALIDATION**: Add business rules and validation
3. **IMPLEMENTATION**: Create clean, working code
4. **QUALITY**: Ensure code follows best practices

### Step 1: Create ALL Value Objects
[For each value object identified in Phase 2, execute:]

```bash
# Create each value object dynamically
{{#each valueObjects}}
[Execute /code:hexagonal:value-object {{../context}} {{this}}]
{{/each}}

# Note: For enum types (like Status, Type, Priority), create manually
{{#each enums}}
[Use Write to create: src/{{../context}}Context/Domain/Shared/ValueObject/{{this}}.php]
{{/each}}
```

### Step 2: Create ID Generators
[For each aggregate identified in Phase 2:]
```bash
{{#each aggregates}}
[Execute /code:hexagonal:id-generator {{../context}} {{this}}]
{{/each}}
```

### Step 3: Create Aggregates
[For each aggregate identified in Phase 2:]
```bash
{{#each aggregates}}
[Execute /code:hexagonal:aggregate {{../context}} {{this}}]
{{/each}}
```

### Step 4: Create Doctrine Entities for Persistence
[For each aggregate that needs persistence:]
```bash
{{#each aggregates}}
[Execute /code:hexagonal:entity {{../context}} {{this}}]
{{/each}}
```
This creates:
- Doctrine ORM entity in `Infrastructure/Persistence/Doctrine/ORM/Entity/`
- Doctrine repository implementation
- Repository interface (if not already exists)

### Step 5: Create Domain Services
[Based on the operations identified, domain services may be needed]
```bash
# Domain services are typically created as part of aggregates
# Additional services can be created manually if needed
[Analyze if any complex operations require domain services]
```

### Step 6: Create ALL Gateways
[For each operation/use case identified in Phase 2:]
```bash
{{#each operations}}
[Execute /code:hexagonal:gateway {{../context}} {{this}}]
{{/each}}
```

### Step 7: Create CQRS Commands and Queries
[If not already created by gateway generation:]
```bash
# Commands (write operations)
{{#each writeOperations}}
[Execute /code:hexagonal:command {{../context}} {{this}}]
{{/each}}

# Queries (read operations)  
{{#each readOperations}}
[Execute /code:hexagonal:query {{../context}} {{this}}]
{{/each}}
```

### Step 8: Verify ALL Components Created
[Use Glob to verify all files exist based on what was identified:]
```bash
# Verify value objects
[Check: src/{{context}}Context/Domain/Shared/ValueObject/*.php]

# Verify aggregates
{{#each aggregates}}
[Check: src/{{../context}}Context/Domain/{{this}}/{{this}}.php]
{{/each}}

# Verify gateways
[Check: src/{{context}}Context/Application/Gateway/*/*.php]

# Verify commands/queries
[Check: src/{{context}}Context/Application/Operation/**/*.php]
```

[Update TodoWrite after EACH component is created]

## Phase 4: Repository and Infrastructure

### Create Repository Interface
[Use Write to create src/{{context}}Context/Domain/Shared/Repository/ArticleRepositoryInterface.php]
Note: This may already be created by the entity command

### Generate Database Migration
After creating the Doctrine entity, generate the migration:
```bash
# Generate migration from entity
[Execute bash docker compose exec app bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff]

# Or use the command
[Execute /code:hexagonal:migration {{context}} create-articles-table]
```

## Phase 5: Business Logic Implementation

Now that ALL scaffolding is complete, implement business logic:

[Create tasks.md with specific business logic implementations]
[Execute implementation following best practices]

## Phase 6: Final Verification and Quality Assurance

### Verify Complete Implementation
- [ ] All value objects created and validated
- [ ] Aggregate created with proper structure
- [ ] Doctrine entity created for persistence  
- [ ] All gateways implemented
- [ ] All commands/queries created
- [ ] Repository interface defined
- [ ] Doctrine repository implementation created
- [ ] Database migration generated
- [ ] Domain events implemented
- [ ] All validation working

[Execute /workflow:qa]

## CRITICAL: Ensure Complete Execution

**This agent MUST:**
1. Create ALL components identified in requirements
2. Not stop after just 2 value objects
3. Execute EVERY scaffolding command
4. Verify each component is created
5. Implement business logic AFTER all structure is created

**If any command fails:**
- Log the error
- Retry or create manually
- Continue with remaining components
- Report all issues at the end

## Key Principles

- **COMPLETE Analysis** - Identify ALL components from requirements, not just some
- **EXHAUSTIVE Execution** - Execute EVERY scaffolding command, don't stop early
- **FULL Coverage** - Create 100% of identified components before business logic
- **Verification Steps** - Check each component is created before proceeding
- **Systematic Approach** - Follow the complete list, don't skip items
- **Error Recovery** - If a command fails, create manually and continue
- **Business Logic** - Implement ONLY after ALL structure is scaffolded

## Common Issues to Avoid

1. **Incomplete Execution**: Don't stop after creating just the first few value objects
2. **Missing Components**: Ensure ALL value objects from the design are created
3. **Skipped Gateways**: Create gateway for EVERY operation identified
4. **Forgotten Events**: Domain events are crucial - create them all
5. **No Repository**: Always create the repository interface for each aggregate

## Execution Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure COMPLETE implementation:

### Value Objects
[Dynamically generated based on components identified in Phase 2:]
{{#each valueObjects}}
- [ ] {{this}} created
{{/each}}
- [ ] All enum types created manually

### Core Domain
[For each aggregate identified:]
{{#each aggregates}}
- [ ] {{this}} aggregate created
- [ ] {{this}} domain events created
- [ ] {{this}}RepositoryInterface created
{{/each}}

### Application Layer  
[For each operation/gateway identified:]
{{#each operations}}
- [ ] {{this}} gateway created
- [ ] {{this}} command/query created
- [ ] {{this}} handler created (if applicable)
{{/each}}

### Infrastructure Layer
- [ ] All Doctrine entities created
- [ ] All repository implementations created
- [ ] Database migrations generated

### Only After ALL Above
- [ ] Create tasks.md for business logic
- [ ] Execute implementation
- [ ] Run quality assurance

This ensures truly complete implementation of hexagonal architecture.
