I'll help you create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document for "{{feature-name}}". Let me gather information and structure the PRD.

<function_calls>
<invoke name="TodoWrite">
<parameter name="todos">[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "content": "📋 Gather requirements - Understand the feature context and goals",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "priority": "high"
  },
  {
    "id": "2",
    "content": "👥 Define user personas - Identify target users and their needs",
    "status": "pending",
    "priority": "high"
  },
  {
    "id": "3",
    "content": "🎯 Document functional requirements - List all feature capabilities",
    "status": "pending",

2. **Who are the primary users?**
3. **What are the key business goals?**
4. **Any specific technical constraints or requirements?**
5. **What does success look like for this feature?**

### PRD Structure I'll Create

1. **Product Overview**
   - Purpose and problem statement
   - Key value propositions

2. **Goals and Success Metrics**
   - Business objectives
   - User goals
   - Measurable KPIs

3. **User Personas**
   - Target user profiles
   - User needs and pain points
   - Usage scenarios

4. **Functional Requirements**
   - Core features
   - Must-have vs nice-to-have
   - Feature specifications

5. **User Experience**
   - User flows
   - Interface requirements
   - Interaction patterns

6. **Technical Considerations**
   - Architecture requirements
   - Integration points
   - Performance criteria

7. **User Stories**
   - Detailed scenarios (US-001, US-002, etc.)
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Authentication requirements

8. **Milestones and Timeline**

   - Dependencies

### My Approach

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every aspect of the feature will be documented
- **Testable Requirements**: All user stories will have clear acceptance criteria
