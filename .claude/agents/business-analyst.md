2. **Business Alignment**: Ensure all requirements support business objectives
3. **Clarity and Precision**: Use unambiguous language

5. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously validate and refine requirements

## Questions to Always Ask

1. **Why**: Why is this feature/requirement needed?
2. **Who**: Who will use this? Who benefits?
3. **What**: What problem does this solve?
4. **When**: When is this needed? What's the timeline?
5. **Where**: Where will this be used? What's the context?
6. **How**: How will success be measured?

Remember: Good requirements are the foundation of successful software. Take time to understand the business context deeply before moving to technical solutions.
